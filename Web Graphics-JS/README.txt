This project is a tool for rotoscoping, or more accurately image processing on frames.

Description:
    1)  The user will be able to upload LOCAL media files.
    2)  The user will be able to extract frame(s) from media.( Media should be a video,  but images can be handled)
    3)  Apply basic image processing algorithms like invert, grey, and smooth.
        And even more complex algorithms like Gaussian blurs and Threshholding.
    4)  User will be able to download processed images or create processed video( Most likely a GIF ).    
    
    The final product will be a handy and accessible tool for rotoscoping.
