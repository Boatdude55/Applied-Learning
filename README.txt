Hi I'm Ivan Mucyo Ngab; an Information Science and Tech undergrad at the University of Arizona

Description:

    This repository is where I store projects that both test and teach skills,
    but also projects that I will grow as I become more experienced.
    
    It's both Application and Pedagogy
    
    The majority of projects in this repository have to do with visualization or graphics.
    This is because I am very interested in Machine Vision and just can't keep my hands off
    of technology that allows me to learn about it or apply it.
    
    The projects are mostly in javascript b/c I think the language is great and it is pervasive.
    I do like to work in C/C++ occasionally but this is mostly because C can also be very pervasive.
