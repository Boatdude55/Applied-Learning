This repository does not include the Electron components of this project and does not include the Node aspects.
It is where I test and clean up prospective modules.

This project is a Linear Algebra Visual tool.
    I think this project is begging to be made Linear Algebra lends itself so well to visual computing

    Goal:   Enables deeper understanding of Linear Algebra concepts and applications.
            Enable users to better use and understand formal mathematical notation by providing a visual aid.
    
    Tools:        
            Components(Work in Progress):
                1) Text Editor: Write formulas and equations or Work problems out.
                2)  C++ calculations.          
                3)  ThreeJS: Visualize text editor.
                
    Currently: Text Editor is not a trivial matter, includes parsing and dataset of exceptable linear algebra
                
            Work around:    For now I will rely on a matrix GUI to build up project.
            
    Pedagogy:   I chose ThreeJS to learn more about WebGL.

                I chose Electron b/c my main goal is to have a HTML, JS, CSS UI for C++ functionality.
                Electron seems well documented and straight forward, also some of my favorite apps are built with it
                
    Libraries and Frame works:  jQuery: DOM handling
                                ThreeJS: Visualizing, WebGL
